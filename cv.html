                <p>
                    I am extremely passionate about programming, and I am ready to take the next step towards 
                    becoming a software Developer. My journey began during my time at Xaverian College, where I 
                    completed my A-levels in Computer Science. This experience ignited my interest in coding and the 
                    vast world of computer science.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout my two years at Xaverian college, my focus was primarily on C# programming for 
                    Computer Science A-level, and I became deeply involved in Object-Oriented Programming. One of 
                    my notable projects involved utilizing SQL to create a comprehensive database for patient bookings. I 
                    took it upon myself to learn SQL outside of class and successfully implemented it in my project. In 
                    addition to my coursework, I have also taken online courses to expand my knowledge of C# and its 
                    various components. Along the way, I became curious about other languages such as HTML and 
                    JavaScript used commonly by Software developer. This continuous interest in programming has led 
                    me to consider an apprenticeship, as I believe it will provide the most effective path for furthering 
                    my growth and expertise in the field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lately, I have been learning on how to develop an app using C# and Xamarin. Forms as I believe this 
                    will help contribute to my programming skills for app development. Whilst attempting to learn about 
                    Xamarin, I encountered XAML which provided me an interesting insight into XML. To improve my 
                    understanding of software and web development, I decided to acknowledge JavaScript, CSS and 
                    HTML and have been implementing them effectively in online projects as I believe this will support 
                    my upcoming career as a software developer. This path has provoked within me a professional 
                    mindset which stimulates hard work and discipline to learn, compile and run code in a robust 
                    manner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, studying Computer Science alongside Mathematics at Xaverian College has proven 
                    immensely beneficial for me. Constant exposure to mathematical equations and problem-solving has 
                    strengthened my analytical thinking and enhanced my problem-solving skills. This skill set allows me 
                    to approach real-world challenges by breaking them down into smaller, manageable steps using 
                    algorithms and logical reasoning. Furthermore, my studies in English Language and Literature at 
                    college have significantly improved my written and oral communication abilities. Through analysing 
                    and deeply interpreting texts and interviews, I have gained knowledge of how individual interact 
                    using formal or informal speech, allowing me to become better at communication depending on 
                    different situations
                </p>
                <p>
                    As for teamworking, during my involvement in the National Citizen Service program, I volunteered to 
                    be part of a team dedicated to community projects. Through this experience, I actively contributed 
                    to various initiatives and further developed my leadership and teamworking skills. Working closely 
                    with my team members, we conceived an innovative idea to sell 1-liter bottles of water at an 
                    affordable price of 50 pence on hot days. Volunteering our time, we aimed to provide a cost-effective 
                    and refreshing solution to passersby. This experience further improved my ability to work in a team 
                    effectively and to speak face to face with customers.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, I am eager about the opportunity to have an apprenticeship as a Software developer. I want to 
                    contribute to creating high-quality software applications using python, JavaScript, and other 
                    languages I will come across. The idea of working within a team and being part of an innovative 
                    environment is exciting to me! I know I still have a lot to learn, but I am determined and ready to 
                    become part of the ever-growing software industry.
